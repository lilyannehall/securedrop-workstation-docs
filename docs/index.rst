Welcome to the SecureDrop Workstation documentation!
====================================================

SecureDrop Workstation is a tool to enable journalists to communicate with
anonymous sources and manage submitted documents, while providing mitigations
against malware and other security risks. It is built on Qubes OS and requires a
`SecureDrop <https://securedrop.org/>`__ server setup.
